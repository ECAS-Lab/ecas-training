    "### How to skip high-volume data transfer and access free computing resources for your CMIP analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## CMCC Demo session \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuesday, 9 March, 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "This online training course aims to increase scientistsâ€™ expertise on data analysis and visualization applied to climate and weather domains, using high-performance data analytics and visualization tools available from the open source market (i.e., Ophidia and its Python bindings, Cartopy, Matplotlib, ...). The course is part of the **Online training on Data Analytics** jointly organized by the H2020 projects IS-ENES3 and EOSC-Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Ophidia\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the outline for the CMCC demo session of the training event. The session is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to the CMCC ECASLab instance and quick demo on how to apply for an account\n",
    "2. Practical overview of data analytics with the Ophidia framework (PyOphidia)\n",
    "3. Hands-on session with some example notebooks with PyOphidia\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Demo* folder contains the notebooks that will be shown during the practical overview demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**PyOphidia_Overview**](./Demo/PyOphidia_Overview.ipynb) shows an overview of how to run some of the main features provided by the Ophidia framework and how to exploit the Onedata features made available within the ECAS environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [**ECAS_B2DROP**](./Demo/ECAS_B2DROP.ipynb) shows how to exploit PyOphidia to download/upload files from/to a B2DROP space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-on Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *Hands-on* folder you can find the notebooks for the hands-on tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the [**Basics**](./Hands-on/1-Basics.ipynb) notebook, which provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the Ophidia operators as well as the PyOphidia library to implement a climate indicator. \n",
    "2. Then, try yourself the other notebooks and get started using the PyOphidia features!\n",
    "  - [**Icing_Days**](./Hands-on/2-Icing_Days.ipynb)\n",
    "  - [**Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb**](./Hands-on/3-Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb)\n",
    "  - [**Time_series_difference**](./Hands-on/4-Time_series_difference.ipynb)\n",
    "  - [**Tropical_Nights**](./Hands-on/5-Tropical_Nights.ipynb)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Note that you can find the complete notebooks under the *notebooks* folder in your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The *notebooks* folder in your home directory contains a set of ready-to-use notebooks that can be executed if you are interested in seeing additional ways of exploiting Ophidia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Aggregated map**](../notebooks/Aggregated_map.ipynb) shows how to create a map from an Ophidia datacube;\n",
    "- [**Frost Days**](../notebooks/Frost_Days.ipynb) shows how to compute the Frost Days indicator;\n",
    "- [**Icing Days**](../notebooks/Icing_Days.ipynb) shows how to compute the Icing Days indicator;\n",
    "- [**Linear_regression**](../notebooks/Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb) provides the user with an exercise regarding linear regression to be performed with the ECAS features and resources;\n",
    "- [**Summer Days**](../notebooks/Summer_Days.ipynb) shows how to compute the Summer Days indicator;\n",
    "- [**Tropical Nights**](../notebooks/Tropical_Nights.ipynb) shows how to compute the Tropical Nights indicator;\n",
