    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the summary for the Virtual Lab activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The *Hands-on notebooks* provide some introductory exercises to experiment with the Ophidia/ECAS features.   \n",
    "- Demo notebooks represent some (bonus) notebooks that can be executed if you are interested in seeing additional ways of exploiting Ophidia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-on Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this folder you can find the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, start from [**ECASLab-Training.ipynb**](./Hands-on/1-ECASLab-Training.ipynb), which provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the Ophidia operators as well as the PyOphidia library to implement a climate indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second notebook [**Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb**](./Hands-on/2-Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb) you can find a more challenging exercise, where you can implement a linear regression experiment to extract the trend from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains a set of ready-to-use noteboks showing different examples of how the Ophidia/ECAS features can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Aggregated map**](./Demo/Aggregated_map.ipynb) shows how to create a map from an Ophidia datacube;\n",
    "- [**Daily Temperature Range**](./Demo/Daily_Temperature_Range.ipynb) shows how to compute the Daily Temperature Range climate indicator.\n",
    "- [**ECAS_Basics**](./Demo/ECAS_Basics.ipynb) provides an overview of how to run some of the basic and most important functionalities;\n",
    "- [**ECAS massive operators**](./Demo/ECAS_massive_example.ipynb) shows an example of how to run massive operators on multiple datacubes \n",
    "- [**Frost Days**](./Demo/Frost_Days.ipynb) shows how to compute the Frost Days indicator;\n",
    "- [**Icing Days**](./Demo/Icing_Days.ipynb) shows how to compute the Icing Days indicator;\n",
    "- [**Linear_regression_ECAS**](./Demo/Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb) provides the user with an exercise regarding linear regression to be performed with the ECAS features and resources;\n",
    "- [**Subsetted map**](./Demo/Linear_regression_ECAS.ipynb) shows how to create a map from a subset of a datacube.\n",
    "- [**Summer Days**](./Demo/Summer_Days.ipynb) shows how to compute the Summer Days indicator;\n",
    "- [**Time series difference**](./Demo/Time_series_difference.ipynb) shows how to perform the difference among two time series;\n",
    "- [**Time series extraction**](./Demo/Time_series_extraction.ipynb) shows how to plot on a map a time series from an Ophidia datacube; \n",
    "- [**Tropical Nights**](./Demo/Tropical_Nights.ipynb) shows how to compute the Tropical Nights indicator;\n",
